# predict-weight
This dataset contains details about 100 participants' health information

**Understanding Supervised Learning** Supervised learning involves predicting an outcome based on labeled data. Initially, I considered this dataset for supervised learning (Classification) applications, particularly for analyzing participants weight based on health information.

Dataset Description 
â€¢ Participant ID: Unique id of participant 
â€¢ Restaurant Name: Name of the restaurant â€¢ Country Code: Country in which restaurant is located â€¢ City: City in which restaurant is located â€¢ Address: Address of the restaurant â€¢ Locality: Location in the city â€¢ Locality Verbose: Detailed description of the locality â€¢ Longitude: Longitude coordinate of the restaurant's location â€¢ Latitude: Latitude coordinate of the restaurant's location â€¢ Cuisines: Cuisines offered by the restaurant â€¢ Average Cost for two: Cost for two people in different currencies ðŸ‘« â€¢ Currency: Currency of the country â€¢ Has Table booking: yes/no â€¢ Has Online delivery: yes/ no â€¢ Is delivering: yes/ no â€¢ Switch to order menu: yes/no â€¢ Price range: range of price of food â€¢ Aggregate Rating: Average rating out of 5 â€¢ Rating color: depending upon the average rating color â€¢ Rating text: text on the basis of rating of rating â€¢ Votes: Number of ratings casted by people

Objective The goal of this analysis is to identify the highest-rated restaurants. While the "rating" column is our main focus, we may also explore how other features relate to it, noting that they can be considered independent variables in this context.

Understanding Data Relationships **Dependent vs. Independent Variables: ** Dependent Variable: In this case, the "rating" column, which we aim to analyze or predict. Independent Variables: Other features such as City, Address, Locality, Locality Verbose, Longitude, Latitude, Cuisines, Average Cost for two, Currency, Has Table booking, Has Online delivery, Is delivering, Switch to order menu, Price range, Aggregate rating, Rating color, Rating text, Votes
