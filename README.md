# predict-weight-dataset
This dataset contains detailed health information for 100 participants.

The weight of participants in this dataset is calculated based on their daily diet habits, lifestyle choices, and physical activity levels. The primary goal is to predict the final weight of each participant, which is the target variable. This target is influenced by various independent features, including age, gender, Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), daily calories consumed, caloric surplus/deficit, physical activity level, macronutrient breakdown, sleep quality, and stress level.

Understanding Supervised Learning:
Supervised learning involves predicting an outcome based on labeled data, where both the input features and the output are known. This dataset is used for supervised learning (specifically regression), where the "Final Weight" column is the outcome we aim to predict based on the other health-related features.

Dataset Description
Participant ID:
A unique identifier assigned to each participant to track their data.

Age:
The participant’s age, which can affect weight changes. Older participants may experience slower metabolism rates, influencing weight gain or loss.

Gender:
The participant’s gender (M/F). Weight can be influenced by biological differences between genders, with males and females often having different caloric requirements and fat distribution patterns.

Current Weight (lbs):
The weight of the participant at the start of the data collection, measured in pounds. This serves as a reference point for tracking weight change over time.

BMR (Calories):
The Basal Metabolic Rate, calculated using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation. It estimates the number of calories burned at rest, which serves as a baseline for understanding how many calories the body needs to function in a state of rest.

Daily Calories Consumed:
The number of calories the participant consumes on a daily basis. This is a key determinant of weight changes, as consuming more calories than the body burns can lead to weight gain, while a calorie deficit can lead to weight loss.

Daily Caloric Surplus/Deficit:
This is the difference between the calories consumed and the participant's BMR. A positive surplus indicates weight gain, while a negative deficit suggests weight loss. It is essential in predicting changes in body weight.

Weight Change (lbs):
The amount of weight the participant gains or loses during the tracking period, in pounds. This is typically calculated by considering the caloric surplus or deficit over time.

Duration (weeks):
The period over which weight change is observed, measured in weeks. Weight change is often tracked over a period of several weeks to understand trends and determine the effectiveness of diet or lifestyle changes.

Physical Activity Level:
The level of physical activity reported by the participant. Categories include Sedentary, Lightly Active, Moderately Active, and Very Active. Higher activity levels generally contribute to higher energy expenditure, influencing weight management.

Macronutrient Breakdown:
The proportions of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats in the participant's diet. This breakdown can provide insight into the nutritional quality of the participant's diet and its effect on weight management and overall health.

Sleep Quality:
A self-reported measure of the participant's sleep quality, categorized as Poor, Fair, Good, or Excellent. Poor sleep quality can affect metabolism and appetite, contributing to weight gain or loss over time.

Stress Level:
A score (1-10) indicating the participant’s perceived stress level. High stress can lead to emotional eating, hormonal changes, and other factors that contribute to weight fluctuations.

Final Weight (lbs):
The participant's weight at the end of the study or data collection period. This is the target variable we aim to predict, and it may be influenced by all other features in the dataset.

Objective:
The goal of this analysis is to predict the final weight of participants. While the "Final Weight (lbs)" column is the target variable, the dataset also provides an opportunity to explore the relationships between other health-related features (independent variables) and weight changes.

Understanding Data Relationships
Dependent vs. Independent Variables:

Dependent Variable: The "Final Weight (lbs)" column is the outcome we are trying to predict.
Independent Variables: All other columns are considered independent variables that may influence the final weight, including Participant ID, Age, Gender, Current Weight, BMR, Daily Calories Consumed, Caloric Surplus/Deficit, Weight Change, Duration, Physical Activity Level, Macronutrient Breakdown, Sleep Quality, and Stress Level.
